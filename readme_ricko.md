## Setup the envirement

Just follow the guide here: https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_getting_started


## Compile

Compile the keyboard with the cli after you have setup the envirement (with env easy then),
```
qmk compile
```

For some reason `qmk flash` did not work for me.

But di just downloaded the qmk toolbox, and then just flash it with that.
